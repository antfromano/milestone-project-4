3. Click “create app”.
4. In the terminal in your app type “npm install -g heroku” and hit enter to install Heroku into your app. The “-g” installs Heroku globally across your project. 
5. Log in to Heroku in the terminal by using “Heroku login -I” then input your email address and password for Heroku.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

Forking the GitHub Repository makes an original repository copy on oGitHub account for viewing and/or making changes but not affecting original repository achieve with the following steps.

1. Log in GitHub and locate [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At top of Repository, locate "Fork" Button where there is now a copy of original repository.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in GitHub and locate [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under repository name, select "Clone or download".
3. For cloning repository using HTTPS copy the link under "Clone with HTTPS".
4. Open Git Bash and modify current working directory to location of your preferred cloned directory.
5. Input `git clone`, and paste copied URL from Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/antfromano/milestone-project-4
```

6. Press Enter. Local clone is created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/antfromano/milestone-project-4
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
